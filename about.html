        <h3 class="subhead text">THE PEOPLE AND THOUGHTS BEHIND WEB DIRECTIONS</h3>
        <p class="copy">Founded in Australia in 2004, by long time web industry figures John Allsopp and Maxine Sherrin, (and now run by John), Web Directions conferences bring together the web industry’s leading experts from around the world to educate and inspire our attendees.<br><br> Our major conferences, Web Directions (Sydney, Australia), Code (Melbourne, Australia) and Respond (Sydney, Australia) cover the full range of interests for web professionals — web design, front-​​end and and back-​​end development, information architecture, interaction design, accessibility, data visualization and much more. We have also produced the groundbreaking GovHack for the Australian Federal Government’s Government 2.0 taskforce.</p>
        <h3 class="subhead text">THE WEB DIRECTIONS APPROACH</h3>
        <p class="copy">Unlike many conferences, we have a editorial approach — we put together programs based on current trends in the industry, and seek out speakers who are working in those areas to give inspiring, entertaining, but most importantly practical presentations. Take a look at our blog and resources site to see slides and hear podcasts from our previous events.  <br><br> 
        But as important as the content is, conferences are also about connecting with your peers — making new connections, and strengthening existing ones, sharing know-​​how and expertise, finding an expert, or new clients. At Web Directions events we pay careful attention to this side of things with social events, and innovative use of social software to help build and strengthen those relationships.  <br><br> With all our conferences and events our commitment is to bring together the best possible speakers — knowledgeable, entertaining, inspiring real world experts cover the issues, technologies, concepts and techniques web professionals need right now keep a clear separation between conference content and commercial communication — we have a clear no “pay to speak” policy provide the best possible value for our attendees — we try to deliver as much as possible, for as little as possible.  help attendees connect with their peers through social events, and our own online networks like tweeps In short — we put together the events we’d want to attend, and we trust you’ll want to as well.</p>
